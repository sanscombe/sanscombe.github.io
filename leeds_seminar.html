<i>Properly ergodic random structures</i><br>
abstract: <i> 
One natural notion of "random $L$-structure" is a probability measure on the space of $L$-structures with domain $\omega$ which is invariant and ergodic for the natural action of $S_{\infty}$ on this space. Such measures arise naturally as limits of sequences of finite structures which are convergent in the appropriate sense, generalizing the graph limits of Lov&aacute;sz and Szegedy. Further, ergodicity tells us that such a measure assigns measure 0 or 1 to any sentence of the infinitary logic $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$, so it makes sense to talk about the theory of a random structure. There is a strong dichotomy between those random structures which are almost surely isomorphic to a given countable structure and those which are not - we call the latter type properly ergodic. We provide a counting types characterization of those sentences of $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ which admit properly ergodic random models. As corollaries, we prove an analogue of Vaught's conjecture in this context, and we show that the complete $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$-theory of any properly ergodic random structure has no models (of any cardinality).

<i>Topological dynamics and definable groups</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Newelski and Pillay proved that, in a NIP theory, topological dynamics applied to the action of a fsg group $G(M)$ on its type space $S_{G}(M)$ gives rise to, and can explain, the quotient $G/G^{00}$. After a brief recall of the theory of compact semigroups, I will describe the main ideas of their papers.

<i>On bounded simplicity of groups of geometric and combinatorial origin</i><br>
abstract: <i>
A group $G$ is simple if, for any elements $f,g\in G$
with $g\neq 1$, $f$ is a product of finitely many conjugates of $g$.
If this finite  number is bounded by $N$ (independently on $f$ and $g$)
we call $G$ <i>$N$-boundedly simple</i>.

We will show that many groups (known to be simple) acting on a line
or a circle, such as various Thompson, Higmann-Thompson, or Neretin
groups, are $N$-boundedly simple with explicit bound for $N$.

Presented results are a joint work with &#346;wiatos&#322;aw R. Gal from
Wroc&#322;aw/Jerusalem/Haifa.

<i>Introduction to automatic homeomorphicity and reconstruction for topological monoids and clones I.</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Transformation Monoids are sets of unary functions on a fixed set closed under composition and containing the identity function. <i>Function Clones (Clones)</i> generalize transformation monoids. Clones carry a natural topology, provided by the topology of pointwise convergence. In this talk some definitions (e.g. abstact clones, topological clones, automatic continuity) and some results obtained by Bodirsky, Pinsker and Pongr&aacute;cz (2014) are studied, these latter are needed in order to present the results related to  the reconstruction of the topology on the monoid of self-embeddings of the rational numbers under the strict order relation, obtained by Prof. John K. Truss and EMVG.

<i>Introduction to automatic homeomorphicity and reconstruction for topological monoids and clones II.</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Function Clones (Clones) over a set $D$ is a set of functions of finite arity on $D$ which is closed under composition and contains the projections. Clones generalize transformation monoids. Clones and transformation monoids  carry a natural topology, provided by the topology of pointwise convergence. A clone $\mathrm{Pol} \left( \mathcal{A} \right)$ has <i>automatic homeomorphicity</i> if every clone isomorphism from $\mathrm{Pol}\left(\mathcal{A}\right)$ to $\mathrm{Pol} \left(\mathcal{B}\right)$ is a homeomorphism. The definition of automatic homeomorphicity first appeared in connection with the reconstruction of the topology of clones, studied by Bodirsky, Pinsker and Pongr&aacute;cz (2014). In this talk, we present the results obtained related to the automatic homeomorphicity of $\mathrm{Pol}\left(\mathbb{Q},\leq \right)$.

<i>Finite and infinite random networks</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Random (di)(multi)graphs and networks have been studied by mathematicians at least since the famous work of Erd&#337;s & R&eacute;nyi of 1959. Their model has been studied from two main angles. Firstly, people have analysed the resulting finite structures, looking at their degree distributions and other properties. Secondly, a remarkable theorem establishes that there is a unique infinite structure which any Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi process approaches with probability one. Model theorists know this object simply as "the random graph".
<br><br>
Recently, network scientists looking to model real-world structures such as the world wide web have turned away from Erd&#337;s-R&eacute;nyi processes and looked to other models. In particular, the "preferential attachment" paradigm of Barab&aacute;si and Albert in 1999 has been intensively studied in recent years, and is a good fit for many real-world networks. However, little work has been done on the infinite limits of such processes. I will report on some recent progress on this question.

<i>Non-standard tangent cones</i><br>
abstract: <i>
This talk will start with the definition of the tangent cone (at a fixed point) of a subset of the Euclidean space. By letting ${}^{*}\mathbb{R}$ denote a non-standard model of the real field $\mathbb{R}$, a similar construction for subsets of ${}^{*}\mathbb{R}^{n}$ will be explored. Particularly, by seeing ${}^{*}\mathbb{R}$ as a real closed valued field, a useful formulation of the tangent cone of definable sets will be presented.

<i>Extremal fields, tame fields, large fields</i><br>
abstract: <i>
In the year 2003 I first heard of the notion of extremal valued fields when Yuri Ershov gave a talk at a conference in Teheran. He proved that algebraically complete discretely valued fields are extremal. However, the proof contained a mistake, and it turned out in 2009 through an observation by Sergej Starchenko that Ershov's original definition leads
to all extremal fields being algebraically closed. In joint work with Salih Durhan (formerly Azgin) and Florian Pop, we chose a more appropriate definition and then characterized extremal valued fields in several important cases.<br><br>

We call a valued field $(K,v)$ extremal if for all natural numbers $n$ and all polynomials $f$ in $K[X_1,...,X_n]$, the set $$\{f(a_1,...,a_n)\;|\;a_1,...,a_n\;\text{in the valuation ring}\}$$ has a maximum (which is allowed to be infinity, which
is the case if $f$ has a zero in the valuation ring). This is such a natural property of valued fields that it is in fact surprising that it has apparently not been studied much earlier. It is also an important property because Ershov's original statement is true under the revised definition, which implies that in particular all Laurent Series Fields over finite
fields are extremal. As it is a deep open problem whether these fields have a decidable elementary theory and as we are therefore looking for complete recursive axiomatizations, it is important to know the elementary properties of them well. That these fields are extremal seems to be an important ingredient in the determination of their structure theory, which
in turn is an essential tool in the proof of model theoretic properties.<br><br>

Further, it came to us as a surprise that extremality is closely connected with Pop's notion of "large field". Also the notion of "tame valued field" plays a crucial role in the characterization of extremal fields. A valued field $K$ with algebraic closure $K^{ac}$ is tame if it is henselian and the ramification field of the extension $K^{ac}|K$ coincides with the algebraic closure.<br><br>

In my talk I will introduce the above notions, try to explain their meaning and importance also to the non-expert, and discuss in detail what is known about extremal fields and how the properties of large and of tame fields appear in the proofs of the characterizations we give. Finally, I will present some challenging open problems, the solution of which may have an impact on the above mentioned problem for Laurent Series Fields over finite fields.

<i>Stacking up components to form Ramsey classes</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Homogeneous shaped partial orders are classified by describing their skeleton, components and allowed two-component and three-component cases. We focus on related Ramsey classes, first defining the components and stating which one component classes are Ramsey. Then we show how to stack up components to get two component Ramsey classes.

Arno Fehm<br>
<i>Almost small absolute Galois groups</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Already Serre's "Cohomologie Galoisienne" contains an exercise regarding the following condition on a field $F$: For every finite field extension $E$ of $F$ and every $n$, the index of the $n$-th powers $(E^{*})^n$ in the multiplicative group $E^{*}$ is finite. Model theorists recently got interested in this condition, as it is satisfied by every superrosy field and also by every $\text{strongly}^2$ dependent field, and occurs in a conjecture of Shelah-Hasson on NIP fields. I will explain how it relates to the better known condition that $F$ is bounded (i.e. $F$ has only finitely many extensions of degree $n$, for any $n$ - in other words, the absolute Galois group of $F$ is a small profinite group) and why it is not preserved under elementary equivalence. Joint work with Franziska Jahnke.

<i>Some results on $T$-convexity</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Let $T$ be an o-minimal theory extending the theory of the real numbers. To any model $R$ of $T$ one can attach a subring $V$ and then study the theory of the pair $(R,V)$. Under some assumptions on $V$ ($T$-convexity), this theory turns out to have very interesting properties ranging from quantifier elimination and existence of definable Skolem functions to weakly o-minimality. I will present some of the results of L. van den Dries and A. H. Lewenberg on this theory.

<i>Motivic Integration, Part 1</i><br>
abstract: <i>
This is the first of a series of talks about motivic integration. Before
speaking about motivic integration itself, I will spend some time on a
simpler variant, namely "uniform $p$-adic integration". Much of the theory
of motivic integration is already visible there, but it has the
advantage of being less abstract.<br><br>

<li>Overview</li>
<li>Some recollection of valued fields (things that Will did not yet say
last week; in particular introduction to the p-adic numbers $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$)</li>
<li>Introduction to one motivation for motivic integration:
representation theory of linear groups over $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$</li>
<li>Model theory of $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$</li>
<li>If time permits: $p$-adic measure and $p$-adic integration</li>

<i>Motivic Integration, Part 2</i><br>
abstract: <i>

<i>Supersimple generalised measurable structures</i><br>
abstract: <i>
I will discuss some recent (and ongoing) work (with Dugald Macpherson, Charlie Steinhorn, and Daniel Wood) about generalised measurable structures. A generalised measurable structure is a structure $\mathcal{M}$, a semiring $R$, and a function $h$ with domain the set of definable sets in $\mathcal{M}$ and codomain $R$, which all satisfy a short list of axioms. The intuition is that $h(X)$ is the `size' of a definable set $X$. Generalised measurable structures can be obtained as ultraproducts of multidimensional asymptotic classes (MACs). In this context, $h(X)$ is a function which, when evaluated in a structure $\mathcal{M}$ from the MAC, gives an approximation to the cardinality of $X(\mathcal{M})$. If we impose the assumption that the semiring $R$ is a polynomial ring in finitely many variables, then our generalised measurable structure must be supersimple. It's also possible to give a description of $D$-rank.

<i>Some combinatorial group theory</i><br>
abstract: <i>
The word norm for any element of a group, given a symmetric generating set, is the length of the shortest representation of that element as a word in the generators. It may also be thought of as the graph norm on the Cayley graph. A <i>quasimorphism</i> from a group $G$ to a normed group (usually the Reals) is a map $f$ such that $d(f(x)f(y),f(xy))$ is absolutely bounded. I will discuss some folklore connecting these combinatorial and geometric ideas.

Taking a clue from Krajicek and Scanlon's definition of the Grothendieck ring of a model-theoretic structure, I will explain how the general machinery of Quillen's $K$-theory can be applied to classify model-theoretic structures. Direct computations in the case of modules will be shown with an emphasis on the role that (partial) elimination of quantifiers plays in the analysis.

<i>Dimension for families of finite first order structures</i><br>
abstract: <i>
A notion of 'quasidimension' for definable sets in families of finite first order structures was proposed by Hrushovski and Wagner, and developed further by Hrushovski in work on approximate subgroups. I will describe joint work with Garcia and Steinhorn developing this. We investigate how quasidimension relates to forking, and find conditions on a class of finite structures which guarantee that all ultraproducts have (super)simple theory.

<i>Valued fields and their model theory</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Given a polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Z}[x_{1},...,x_{n}]$ there are two a priori very different questions:<br>
(a) describe the singularities of $f=0$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$<br>
(b) count solutions of $f=0$ in $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ modulo some $m\in\mathbb{N}$.<br><br>
I'll give a little series of talks, whose final goal is a result about stratifications in valued fields, which are useful for both (a) and (b).<br><br>
This first talk will be an introduction to valued fields and hopefully to the most important model theoretic results about valued fields.

<i>Model theory of valued fields and Poincar&eacute; series</i><br>
abstract: <i>
This is the second talk of this little series. This time, I will speak about the model theory of henselian valued fields. More precisely, I will explain what kind of quantifier elimination one has and what this implies. Moreover, I'll present the Poincar&eacute; series associated to definable sets in $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$. A famous result from the 80s is that this Poincar&eacute; series is a rational function. This can be considered as a partial understanding of definable sets up to isometry.<br><br>
I will also say a few words about how this is related to questions from Number Theory.

<i>Poincar&eacute; series and stratifications</i><br>
abstract: <i>
A surprising result from the 80ies is that Poincar&eacute; series are rational. This can be considered as a (strange) statement about isometry types of definable sets in valued fields. I will explain this, and I will present a result (about the existence of certain stratifications) which completely classifies these isometry types and thereby giving a geometric explanation of the rationality of the Poincar&eacute; series.

<i>Existentially and universally definable valuation rings</i><br>
abstract: <i>
We give an exposition of results in recent papers (of Cluckers-Derakhshan-Leenknegt-Macintyre, and joint work of the speaker with Fehm and Koenigsmann) about the definability of valuation rings in valued fields by existential formulas and by universal formulas, using few parameters. We mainly work in power series fields and use parameters from the embedded residue field.

<i>Statifications and Poincar&eacute; series</i><br>
abstract: <i>
In this last talk of the series, I will finish presenting the stratifications which describe definable sets in valued fields up to isometry, and I'll show how this indeed implies rationality of Poincar&eacute; series. If there's time, I'll also explain how the stratifications in valued fields yield Whitney stratifications in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$.

<i>Model Theoretic Properties of CFPOs</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Cycle-free partial orders are a generalisation of trees, in that they can branch down as well as up. I will show when they are interpretable with trees and then use this to show that the theory of CFPOs is both NIP and inp-minimal.

<i>Reducts of the Generic Ordered Graph</i><br>
abstract: <i>
Loosely speaking, a reduct of a structure $M$ is a less detailed version of $M$ obtained from $M$ be discarding information. The reducts of various structures have been classified; the two best know examples are the random graph and $(\mathbb{Q},<)$. In this talk, I will quickly describe the reducts of these two structures before going on to discuss the paper by Bodirsky, Pinsker and Pongracz in which they determine the reducts of the generic ordered graph.

<i>Definable Amenability of NIP Theories</i><br>
abstract: <i> 
In NIP theories, a global type which is finitely satisfiable in small submodel is "Borel definable" over such submodel. If we assume NIP, and consider a definable group $G(x)$ which has fsg, that is, there exists a global type $p(x)\vdash G(x)$ such that every left translation of $p(x)$ is finitely satisfiable in a small submodel. Then, by Borel definability of $p(x)$, for each definable subset $X$ of $G$, $X/G^{00}$ should be a Borel subset of the compact group $G/G^{00}$, and the Haar measure of $X/G^{00}$ gives $X$ a left invariant measure. Moreover, $X$ has positive measure iff $X$ is finitely satisfiable in every small submodel, such $G$ is called definable amenable group.
