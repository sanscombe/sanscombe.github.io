**Title.**
Hilbert's Tenth Problem and henselian valuations

**Abstract.**
Hilbert's Tenth Problem --- originally posed for the ring
$R=\mathbb{Z}$ --- asked for an algorithm to determine,
for any multivariable polynomial,
whether or not it has a zero in $R$.
The celebrated theorem of Matiyasevich in 1970
--- building on work of Davis, Putnam, and Robinson ---
showed that no such algorithm exists for $R=\mathbb{Z}$!

I will speak about Hilbert's Tenth Problem in the context of fields equipped with a henselian valuation.
