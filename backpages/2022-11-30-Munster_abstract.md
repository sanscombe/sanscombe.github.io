**Title.**
Existential theories of classes of fields --- henselian and otherwise

**Abstract.**
I have spoken before about joint work with Fehm on the existential
theory of power series fields $$F(\!(t)\!)$$,
and more recently on work with
Dittmann and Fehm on the analogous theories in a language with an
additional parameter for the uniformizer.
In the former case we found a transfer of decidability:
the existential theory is decidable if and
only if the existential theory of $F$, as a field, is decidable.
In the latter case, we obtained the same transfer,
but in positive characteristic this is conditional on a consequence of local
uniformization, a major open conjecture.
In an ongoing project (again with Fehm),
we broaden these transfer results to deal with classes of residue fields.
One surprising result gives Turing equivalences
between the existential theory of $\mathbb{Q}$ and a number of existential
theories of henselian and large fields.
