**Title.**
Asymptotic classes of finite structures and their ultralimits.

**Abstract.**
I will discuss several notions
--- 'one dimensional asymptotic classes' and 'multidimensional asymptotic classes' --- 
that are defined for classes of finite structures,
and describe when the sizes of the definable sets in these structures satisfy certain asymptotic formulas.
There is an infinite counterpart to these definitions:
the 'measurable' and 'generalized measurable' structures.
More precisely, an infinite structure $M$ is generalized measurable if there is a
'measuring function' from the family of definable sets in $M$ into a
'measuring semiring'
(which are certain ordered semirings)
satisfying axioms that are intended to capture aspects of the intuitive notions of measure and dimension.

The motivating examples for measurable structures as pseudofinite
fields, and in this talk 
I will give examples of generalized measurable structures and describe
what is known regarding the stability-theoretic properties of
generalized measurable structures.
This is joint work with Macpherson, Steinhorn, and Wolf, and it
generalises the work on one-dimensional asymptotic classes and measurable structures introduced by Macpherson and Steinhorn in their 2008 paper.
