1. We begin by recalling _languages_, _theories_, and _structures_.
	- Languages are tuples
	$$((f_{i})_{i\in I},(R_{j})_{j\in J},(c_{k})_{k\in K})$$
	with associated _arities_ for the function and relation symbols.
	- An $L$-structure is a tuple
	$$M=(M,(f_{i}^{M})_{i\in I},(R_{j}^{M})_{j\in J},(c_{k}^{M})_{k\in K})$$
	where each $f_{i}^{M}$ is an operation on $M$ of the right arity,
	each $R_{j}^{M}$ is a relation on $M$ of the right arity,
	and each $c_{k}^{M}$ is an element of $M$.
	- We build $L$-formulas and $L$-sentences, and $L$-theories are simply sets of $L$-sentences.
	- Given an $L$-structure $M$, and $L$-formula $\varphi(x)$, and an $x$-tuple $a\subset M$, we define 'satisfaction' $$M\models\varphi(a)$$, by recursion on the complexity of $\varphi$.
	- We generally assume theories to be consistent: to have a model.

2. Examples
	- Groups (note the choice of language)
	- Pure sets
	- Rings and fields
	- Vector spaces (discuss choice between two languages)
	- Peano arithmetic
	- Graphs
	- DLO

3. **The Compactness Theorem.** A theory $\Gamma$ is satisfiable if and only if it is satisfiable.

4. Countable models and
$$I(T,\aleph_{0})$$
	- $\omega$-categoricity: examples and non-examples
		- Pure set
		- Vector spaces
		- Algebraically closed fields
		- Random graph
		- DLO
	- A technical tool:
		- **Omitting Types Theorem.**

	- **Vaught's "Not $2$" Theorem.**
	Let $T$ be a complete theory in a countable language.
	Then $I(T,\aleph_{0})\neq2$.
	Moreover, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}\setminus\{2\}$ there exists such a $T$ with $I(T,\aleph_{0})=n$.
	- **Ryll-Nardzewski Theorem.**
	Let $T$ be a complete theory with infinite models in a countable language.
	Then $T$ is $\omega$-categorical iff and only if $T$ has finitely many complete $n$-types, for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$.
	- **Vaught's Conjecture.**
	Let $T$ be a complete theory in a countable language.
	Then we do not have
	$$\aleph_{0}<I(T,\aleph_{0})<2^{\aleph_{0}}$$.

5. Miscellany
	- Bi-embeddability versus isomorphism: examples
	- Elementary version

6. Uncountable spectrum
	- $I(T,\kappa)$
	- **Morley's Theorem.**
	- **Shelah's Main Gap** and its philosophy
