[//]: #		Propositional proof complexity is the study of algorithms that recognize the set of tautologies in propositional logic. Initially conceived as an approach to address the “P versus NP” problem in computational complexity, the field has gradually expanded its focus to include new objectives. Among these is the goal of providing a theoretical foundation for comparing the effectiveness of heuristics for algorithms that exhaustively explore the solution spaces of combinatorial problems. Dually, and complementarily, the methods of proof complexity can also be used to assess how to certify that a given exploration path of such an algorithm ultimately leads to a dead end. A notable challenge faced by this methodology lies in the fact that, despite the theoretically proved modelling power of propositional logic, as established by the theory of NP-completeness, propositional logic is not always the best specification language for all application domains. Addressing this challenge involves studying the expressive power of various languages and their associated proof systems through the lens of computational complexity.
