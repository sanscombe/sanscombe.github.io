1. [Bahareh Afshari][Afshari]
- _Reasoning About Time_

    Temporal logic encompasses a family of logics equipped with unary and binary operators that express temporal properties such as ‘eventually’ and ‘always’. These logics play a central role in the theory of computation, where the succinct specification and tractable verification of state-based systems are essential for reliable and efficient system design. This course offers an introduction to temporal logic and the proof systems developed for reasoning about them. We demonstrate how formal proofs can be used to analyse fundamental computational properties, including decidability and interpolation. The second half of the course explores more advanced topics, including infinitary and cyclic proof systems.

- _Existentially closed fields with an automorphism and difference algebraic geometry_

    In this talk, we will discuss the model theory of fields with automorphisms, in particular the existence of a model companion.
We will also discuss the arithmetic flavour of this model companion: it is the asymptotic theory of algebraically closed fields in positive characteristic with the Frobenius automorphism, generalising a theorem of Ax on the model theory of finite fields.
This follows from Hrushovski’s twisted Lang-Weil estimates. Time permitting we will discuss the finer model theoretic properties of this model companion: (super)simplicity, elimination of imaginaries…

    - _Valued fields with an automorphism_

    In this second talk we will explore the model theory of valued difference fields. Appearing in Hrushovski’s proof of the twisted Lang-Weil estimates, they went on to have a life of their own.
We will first describe a class of (relatively) existentially closed difference valued fields in characteristic zero, as well as the recent breakthrough in positive characteristic by Dor and Hrurshovski.
Finally we will discuss the question of the classification of imaginaries in valued difference fields.

1. [Tingxiang Zou][Zou]
- _Pseudofinite counting dimension_

    Pseudofinite structures are ultraproducts of finite structures. In such structures, one has access to a non-standard notion of counting cardinality. In this talk, I will discuss two dimensions on definable sets arising from this non-standard counting, namely the fine and coarse counting dimensions, introduced by Hrushovski. I will explain their basic properties, the associated independence relation, and their connections to other notions of dimension and independence arising in algebra and model theory more generally. Finally, I will discuss the Larsen–Pink inequality from the perspective of these counting dimensions.

    - _The Elekes-Szabó Theorem_

    The Elekes-Szabó Theorem can be stated informally as follows. Let $R \subseteq C^{3}$ be an algebraic surface defined over a field $K$ of characteristic $0$, where $C$ is an irreducible curve defined over $K$, such that any two coordinates are interalgebraic with the third (for example, the collinearity relation for three distinct points on a curve). Suppose that there exist arbitrarily large finite subsets $A \subseteq C(K)$ of size $n$ such that the intersection of $R$ with $A^3$ has size approximately $n^2$. Then $R$ is essentially the graph of the group operation of a one-dimensional algebraic group $G$.

    In this talk, I will explain how pseudofinite coarse dimension and model-theoretic techniques, for example, the group configuration theorem, together with combinatorial tools can be used to give a clean proof of the Elekes–Szabó theorem. I will also discuss higher-dimensional generalisations.
