\section*{Abstract}


Abstract: A classical theorem in model theory of valued fields, proven
independently by Ax-Kochen and Ershov, allows to reduce the complete
theory of a henselian valued field of equicharacteristic $0$ to that of
its value group and residue field. This gives in particular an
asymptotic transfer between the p-adic numbers and power series fields
$F_p((t))$ in positive characteristic. In the first lecture, I will
discuss this classical transfer theorem and some of its generalizations.
In the second lecture, I will discuss recent joint work with
Konstantinos Kartas how these principles can adapted to perfectoid
fields, which gives a method of determining which first order properties
tilt and untilt. In particular, our approach yields a simple
model-theoretic proof of the Fontaine-Wintenberger Theorem.
