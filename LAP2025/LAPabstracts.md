1. [Jonathan Kirby][JK]:
	- _Some Model Theory of Exponential Fields._

		I will survey some of the work done towards understanding the model theory of exponential fields, particularly around Zilber's approach to the complex exponential field, and the progress towards his conjecture that it is quasiminimal and does not interpret the real field.

1. [Chris Lambie-Hanson][CLH]:
	- _Set theory and derived functors._

		These talks will be broadly concerned with the study of questions of compactness, i.e., questions regarding the extent to which the global properties of a structure are determined by its local properties. Such questions are central to the fields of both homological algebra, where failures of local to global phenomena are explicitly measured via derived functors, and set theory, where sophisticated methods have been developed to either construct incompact objects or prove that, at least consistently, they do not exist. These talks will survey some applications of ideas and techniques from set theory to questions about derived functors coming from homological algebra. In the first lecture, we will survey some now-classical results, including Shelah's work on the Whitehead problem and results of Goblot and Mitchell on derived limits. In the second lecture, we will discuss recent progress on applications of set theory to the study of higher derived limits. No prior knowledge of homological algebra will be necessary; we will focus on the combinatorial ideas underlying the applications.

1. [Mariana Vicaria][MV]:
	- _Model theory of valued fields._

		In this sequence of talks I will do an introduction to valued fields and a survey on their study from a model theoretic perspective. In particular I will introduce on the spine philosophy of the Ax-Kochen/Ershov principle, which roughly states that the first order theory of a henselian valued field of equicharacteristic zero is completely determined by the first order theory of its residue field and the first order theory of its value group. I will later present how many model theoretic questions about a henselian valued field of equicharacteristic zero can be tackled following this principle (e.g. field quantifier elimination, transfer principle of the combinatorial complexity, elimination of imaginaries, etc.).
