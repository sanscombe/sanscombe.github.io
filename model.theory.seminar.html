Higher amalgamation in measurable structures
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
The concept of MS-measurable structures appeared as a generalization of a result of Chatzidakis-van den Dries-Macintyre about the asymptotic size of definable sets in the class of finite fields, and have been extensively studied in recent years by several researchers (Macpherson, Steinhorn, Elwes, Ryten, Wolf, Anscombe, among others).
MS-measurable structures are known to be supersimple of finite U-rank, and some examples are provided by taking infinite ultraproducts of the following classes of finite structures:
 the class of finite fields, the class of cyclic groups, the Paley graphs (whose infinite ultraproducts are elementarily equivalent to the random graph), the class of finite groups of fixed Lie type, etc. 
<br><br>
In this talk I will present a survey on unpublished work of David Evans about MS-measurable structures,
 in which he uses Towsner's proof of Szemeredi's theorem to show that a
"higher amalgamation property"
holds for MS-measurable structures, but not generally in structures which are supersimple of finite U-rank. In addition, Evans shows that some of Hrushovski's non locally modular supersimple omega-categorical structures are not MS-measurable, answering negatively a question of Elwes and Macpherson about the MS-measurability for supersimple finite U-rank unimodular structures.

Definability of ranks (in families) in differential fields
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
As the theory $DCF_{0,m}$ of differentially closed fields of characteristic zero with several commuting derivations is omega-stable, we have at our disposal Morley and Lascar rank. A natural question to ask is whether these ranks are definable in families of definable sets. The answer is "no" (for instance, one can see this using results on the 2nd Painlev&eacute; equation).
Nonetheless, we have another notion of rank in this context: the Kolchin polynomial.
In this talk I will explain why this rank is in fact definable.
This is joint work with G. Binyamini, J. Freitag and W. Li.

A polynomial is anything that can be formed from variables and complex numbers using the operations of addition and multiplication.
An exponential polynomial is anything that can be formed from variables and complex numbers using addition, multiplication and the function $\exp$.
The study of $\mathbb{C}_{\exp}$ inevitably involves the study of exponential polynomials.
I shall discuss these with reference to what is known about polynomials.

A special case of quasi-minimality
</i>

abstract: <i>
Zilber conjectured that every subset of the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ which is first-order definable in the complex exponential ring $\mathbb{C}$ is either countable or cocountable.
We prove this in the special case of a set arising as the projection to $\mathbb{C}$ of the solution set of a single exponential polynomial equation.
By an exponential polynomial we mean anything formed from variables and complex numbers using the operations of addition, multiplication and $\exp$ (so we allow $\exp$ of $\exp$).

On universal specializations of non-locally modular Zariski geometries
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
Specializations are the key tool in proving the Trichotomy Theorem for Zariski geometries.
In this talk I will concentrate on a special class of specializations,
called the $\kappa$-universal specializations.
The focus of the talk will be on non-locally modular Zariski geometries that only admit $\kappa$-universal specializations.
Contrary to the initial intuition this is not the case for all non-locally modular Zariski geometries.
I will give some conditions for certain non-locally modular Zariski geometries under which all specializations are $\kappa$-universal.
I will also explain how these conditions are related to the conditions given by Serre,
under which any principal bundle over an algebraic variety is locally isotrivial.

On rational numbers
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
"Rational numbers are easier to handle than real numbers
because with rationals you can only do algebra,
whereas the reals lead you straight into calculus,
differential equations,
integrals and other tough business."
We will contrast this widespread view with the by now well understood phenomenon
that the algebra of the reals is much easier than the algebra of the rationals.
To illustrate this, we will present two big open problems about the rationals
(one along the lines of Hilbert's 10th problem,
the other going back to Grothendieck's "anabelian geometry"),
explaining very recent progress towards their solution.

Modey Theory of profinite groups
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
I will discuss recent work with Katrin Tent where we consider a profinite group $G$ as a $2$-sorted structure with a second sort which codes (as a uniformly definable family) the system of all open subgroups of $G$.
The main theorem is that the theory is $\mathbf{NTP}$ (or just $\mathbf{NTP2}$) if and only if $G$ has an open subgroup which is a direct product of finitely many compact $p$-adic analytic groups (for different primes $p$).

When does dependence transfer from a field to henselian expansions?
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
Let $K$ be an NIP field and let $v$ be a henselian valuation on $K$.
We ask whether $(K,v)$ is NIP as a valued field.
By a result of Shelah, we know that if $v$ is externally definable,
then $(K,v)$ is NIP.
Using the definability of the canonical $p$-henselian valuation,
we show that whenever the residue field of $v$ is not separably closed,
then $v$ is externally definable.
Time permitting,
we also discuss the case of separably closed residue fields.

On Convex valuations of ordered fields

I will give a brief introduction to Dedekind cuts of ordered fields and explain how these can be used to understand convex valuations of ordered fields.
Further I will show a method to manufacture convex subrings that are definable in a given ordered field.
The talk will finish with a few applications to henselian ordered fields.

Decidability for theories of modules of tame canonical algebras
</i><br>
abstract: <i>
A long standing conjecture of Mike Prest claims that a finite-dimensional algebra has decidable theory of modules if and only if it is of tame representation type.

Up until recently, all known examples of finite-dimensional algebras with decidable theory of modules were of tame domestic representation type.

In this seminar, I will talk about how to prove that all tame canonical algebras over algebraically closed fields have decidable theory of modules. Tame canonical algebras are tame non-domestic of linear growth.

I will explain in the seminar what the terms tame, domestic and linear growth mean.

Limit Independence
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
Given a large model $M$ of some theory $T$, I will describe a
method for lifting well-behaved notions of independence from the theories
of substructures of $M$ to a reasonably well-behaved notion of
independence in $M$. (In essence, we take the limit of the independence
relations in the substructures.) The motivating example - two-sorted
theories of infinite-dimensional vector spaces over an algebraically
closed field and with a bilinear form - was worked out by N. Granger in
his thesis.

title: <i>
In search of a complete axiomatization for $\mathbb{F}_{p}((t))$
</i>
<br>
abstract: <i>
I will give a survey of the attempts that have been made since the mid 1960s to find a complete recursive axiomatization of the elementary theory of ${\mathbb F}_p((t))$. This problem is still open, and I will describe the difficulties researchers have met in their search. Some new hope has been generated by Yu. Ershov's observation that ${\mathbb F}_p((t))$ is an "extremal" valued field. However, while his intuition was good, his definition of this notion was flawed. It has been corrected in a paper by Azgin, Kuhlmann and Pop, in which also a partial characterization of extremal fields was given. Further progress has been made in a recent paper, completed in joint work with S. Anscombe.

The property of being an "extremal valued field" is both elementary and very natural, so it is an ideal candidate for inclusion in a (hopefully) complete recursive axiomatization for ${\mathbb F}_p((t))$. It implies an axiom scheme that was considered previously, which describes the behaviour of additive polynomials under the valuation. I will discuss why additive polynomials are crucial for the model theory of valued fields of positive characteristic.

The open problems around extremal fields provide a good source of research projects of various levels of difficulty for young researchers.
